The idea is to allow users to create an interactive map where they can either post their own challenges or generate ones automatically.

### Key Features

- **Create Interactive Maps**: Users can create and customize maps with various challenges.
- **Post Challenges**: Share personal challenges or generate new ones for others to complete.
- **Photo Uploads**: Complete challenges by uploading photos as proof.
- **Generate GIFs and Links**: After completing challenges, generate GIFs or shareable links showcasing your adventure.
- **Print Your Trip**: Print your map and challenge results to keep as a memento.

### Purpose

This project is developed as a personal project for my holidays in August, aiming to provide a fun and engaging way to make the most out of summer activities.
And also to share it with my friends
